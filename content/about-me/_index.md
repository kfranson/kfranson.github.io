My primary research interest is studying the formation and atmospheres of giant planets on wide orbits through high-contrast imaging. I am currently leading a multi-facility direct imaging survey of the most promising young accelerating stars between Hipparcos and Gaia. This efficient campaign has already produced exciting discoveries including AF Lep b, the lowest-mass imaged exoplanet with a direct, dynamical mass measurement. I also work more broadly on characterizing the atmospheres of planets and brown dwarfs and testing substellar evolutionary models with dynamical mass measurements. Looking forward, I am excited to combine Gaia DR4 astrometry with next-generation high-contrast imagers to dramatically expand the sample of imaged exoplanets.

Outside of research, I am passionate about mentorship and outreach, serving as an informal mentor for several undergraduate students and co-organizing Starbound planetarium visits at local schools. Outside of astronomy, I enjoy playing music, cooking, and spending time with our [two greyhounds](uploads/hounds.jpg).
