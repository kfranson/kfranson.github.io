# Hi, I'm Kyle Franson

I am a final-year graduate student at The University of Texas at Austin studying giant exoplanets with [Prof. Brendan P. Bowler](https://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~bpbowler/). My research combines astrometry and high-contrast imaging to discover and characterize exoplanets on wide orbits. In September, I will start as a [NASA Sagan Fellow](https://www.stsci.edu/stsci-research/fellowships/nasa-hubble-fellowship-program/2025-nhfp-fellows#section-ee3cd148-a284-4897-b971-73f7cbd61f6d) at the University of California, Santa Cruz.

If you're interested in my work or potential collaborations, feel free to check out my [CV](uploads/franson_CV.pdf) or [contact me](mailto:kfranson@utexas.edu)!
