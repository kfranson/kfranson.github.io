I have carried out the measurement of the dynamical masses of two known brown dwarf companions [HD 984 B](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2022AJ....163...50F/abstract) and [PZ Tel B](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165..246F/abstract), and one brown dwarf companion discovered through my survey [HIP 21152 B](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....165...39F/abstract). Dynamical masses of substellar companions offer rare opportunities to test substellar evolutionary models and their underlying assumptions about the formation and thermal evolution of substellar objects. Hipparcos-Gaia accelerations have recently opened up these valuable direct mass measurements for a small sample of long-period planets and brown dwarf companions. Both HD 984 B and PZ Tel B's dynamical masses are broadly consistent with hot-start evolutionary models. HIP 21152 B has a lower dynamical mass than predicted by models. Gaia DR4 astrometry is poised to improve the precision of these and other dynamical mass measurements.
