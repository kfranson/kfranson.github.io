I am leading a multi-facility high-contrast imaging survey of the most promising young, nearby accelerating stars to efficiently discover new long-period planet and brown dwarf companions. The highlight of this program has been the discovery of AF Lep b with the [NIRC2 camera](https://www2.keck.hawaii.edu/inst/nirc2/) at [Keck Observatory](https://www.keckobservatory.org). With a dynamical mass of $3 \, M_\mathrm{Jup}$ and semi-major axis of 9 au, **it is the lowest-mass imaged exoplanet with a direct mass measurement.** This is an exciting addition to the small sample of directly imaged planets! The planet shows evidence of [spin-orbit alignment](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...950L..19F/abstract), [enhanced atmospheric metallicity](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023AJ....166..198Z/abstract), [a circular orbit](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2024arXiv240601809B/abstract) similar to other imaged planets, and a [potential](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...950L..19F/abstract) [delay](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/2515-5172/ad4481/ampdf) in its formation revealed by its dynamical mass. These lines of evidence suggest that the planet likely formed through core accretion.
